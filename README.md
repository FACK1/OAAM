## Why 

#### As individuals: We made this project to realize our own strengths and weaknesses when asked to make a full product in a professional setting. We can say with confidence that it was an experiment which was both a refresher and an eye opener as to what we’re missing and what we’re capable of. We realized that we need to make much needed progress in some of the technologies that some may consider simple or easy to pick up. 

#### As a group: This project was a real tester to how well or bad we could work together. It was meant to test our patience, our tolerance and our ability to work out the challenges and problems that we faced throughout.

#### It was also made to test our understanding of Gitwork-flow and how to deploy our changes and projects. 

## What

#### We made a small portfolio site for an imaginary company specializing in web development, web design, and graphic design. Whilst keeping in mind the different kinds of people that may want to access it. We also kept in mind the different devices that may be used to browse it. The idea behind the site is advertising the skills and experience of our group whilst keeping the client in focus the entire time. The site doesn’t rely on words and selling ourselves as much as it relies to our client what we’re capable of. 

#### The Technologies we used were: HTML & CSS. 

## How

#### As a group: We decided to experiment with working individually; each tackling a section and a problem, initially. Then after assembling said sections together, we started working out what needs to be added, fixed, or modified as a group. Each one of us made suggestions and we were all partners in decision making and what’s the best course of action may be.

#### We divided the site in three sections:

#### 1- The header: It contained the name of the company in a main heading, with a sub-heading of a short description of what the company does and is all about. It also contained a nav bar with several sections to make for easy access and navigation.

#### 2- The body: It contained 3 sections: The first is the “about”section, to talk about the company in a short but more descriptive way. The second is the “team” section, to show the amount of experience our team has in the industry whilst providing links to further manifest their coding ability. The third one "contact us" contained a form for the client to fill in order to be able to get in touch with us. 

#### 3- The footer: It contained the copy rights of the site to prevent it from getting stolen or copied. 

## What we learned from this experience:

#### You’re not as good as you think you are. Practice to make perfect, for talent betrays many, but hard work betrays none.

#### Working in groups isn’t that bad if you constantly communicate and take each other’s opinions into consideration every step of the way.

#### Don’t freak out if you don’t know how to do something in particular. Search it up on google, experiment with it first, and remember to ask someone.
